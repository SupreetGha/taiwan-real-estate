## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting real estate home prices in Taiwan using machine learning techniques. It consists of two Jupyter notebooks:

- **real_estate_eda.ipynb** - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and storage in MongoDB.
- **real_estate_model.ipynb** - Machine Learning model development for fire prediction.

## 📊 Data & Analysis

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset, handling missing values.
- Conducted feature engineering and transformations.
- Visualized key relationships using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

### 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- Encoded categorical variables and split the data into training and testing sets.
- Used **RandomizedSearchCV** and **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.
- Built and evaluated a predictive model for fire occurrence based on meteorological factors.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas, NumPy** 📊
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** 📈
- **MongoDB** 🗄️
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓

## 📢 Results & Insights
- Identified key factors influencing home prices.
- Developed a machine learning model to predict home prices.
- Improved model accuracy through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
