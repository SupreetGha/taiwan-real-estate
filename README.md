  <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning Model</strong><br>
  A data-driven approach to understanding and predicting forest fires in Algeria.
</p>

## 📌 Project Overview

This project consists of two Jupyter notebooks that analyze and predict forest fires in Algeria using machine learning techniques. The goal is to extract insights from the dataset and build a predictive model.

- **Algerian_Forest_Fires_EDA.ipynb** - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
- **Algerian_Forest_Fire_Model.ipynb** - Machine Learning model for fire prediction.

## 📊 Data & Analysis

- Conducted **data cleaning** and **feature engineering**.
- Visualized key patterns in the dataset related to temperature, humidity, wind, and fire occurrences.
- Performed **correlation analysis** and feature selection.
- Trained and evaluated a machine learning model for fire prediction.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy 📊
- Matplotlib, Seaborn 📈
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
